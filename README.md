## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I eventually got to my answer after tinkering with the width and sizes of the container and image and I got to this. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.wrapper::before {
    border-top-left-radius: 0;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
  }

  .wrapper img {
    border-top-left-radius: 0;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: 456px;
    object-fit: cover;
    
  }
```
