## My process

1. Initialized project as a public repository 
2. Configured repository to publish your code to a web address. 
3. Looked through the designs to started planning. 
4. Wrote HTML classes and added divs or sections.
5. Wrote out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Jumped back and forth for a while. 
7. After using dev tools to check responsiveness on various screen sizes I concluded that the project was complete. 
8. Final Push 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I eventually got to my answer after tinkering with the width and sizes of the container and image and I got to this. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.wrapper::before {
    border-top-left-radius: 0;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
  }

  .wrapper img {
    border-top-left-radius: 0;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: 456px;
    object-fit: cover;
    
  }
```

### Continued development

Centering the div of course and attaching images to be responsive in relation to the contianers.
